# HuBot: A Biomimicking Mobile Robot for Non-Disruptive Bird Behavior Study

Welcome to the official repository for **HuBot**, a biomimetic mobile robot designed for non-invasive wildlife monitoring and ecological research. This repository hosts the dataset, methodologies, and results associated with the HuBot project.

## Overview

The **Houbara bustard** is a critically endangered bird species that poses challenges for traditional research due to its elusive nature and sensitivity to human disturbances. To overcome these limitations, we introduce **HuBot**, a biomimetic robot designed to seamlessly integrate into the Houbara's natural habitat. Leveraging cutting-edge object detection algorithms and robust hardware, HuBot enables unprecedented insights into the Houbara's movement patterns, social interactions, and habitat use.
